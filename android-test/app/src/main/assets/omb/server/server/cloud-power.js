// A Cloud home's power: whether it is busy, and the sleep handshake with the Admin (docs/cloud-pro.md, "Sleeping
// homes"). The home never stops itself: on a plan that sleeps, the Admin reads `report()` about once a minute through
// its signed `GET /api/cloud/power`, asks `prepareSleep()` through `POST /api/cloud/power/sleep` once the home is idle,
// then suspends the machine (or stops it) and wakes it again before the next scheduled run. On every other plan the Admin
// never asks, and nothing here changes how the home behaves.
//
// Privacy: the report carries fixed codes and times only, like the health report.
